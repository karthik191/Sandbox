Iâ€™m Karthik Shekarappa, pursuing master studies in California State University Sacramento. I presently work with Intel Corporation, Folsom in a physical design team focusing on Design Automation, supporting, improving efficiency of Physical designers. This internship has helped me grow exponentially in terms of both technical and personality development.\nI'm seeking full time opportunity in the field of Analog/Digital Logic design, Design Verification / Validation, Physical design or Computer Architecture. I'm well-prepared to align my skill set with any position that requires a proactive individual who strives to exceed expectations on every assignment.\nPlease find the attached resume for your reference.\nHere is a summary of my profile:\n\
    \t1. In-depth understanding of CMOS digital, analog, and I/O circuit design. Knowledge in transistor level circuit simulation tools as PSpice.\n\
    \t2. Skilled in defining functionality and RTL design abstracts.\n\
    \t3. Good understanding and knowledge about ASIC design flow\n\
    \t4. Related Coursework in Micro Computer System Design and Advance Computer Architecture.\n\
    \t5. Significant knowledge in Static Timing Analysis and scripting languages.\n\
    \t6. Familiarity with Synopsys RTL synthesis tools.\n\
    \t7. Good understanding in industry standard design environment.\n\
    \t8. Knowledge of DRC, LVS, and post-layout extraction tools.\n\
    \t9. Strong Practical Experience in using EDA tools such as Cadence Virtuoso\n\
    \t10. Proficient in Mixed Signal IC Design, ASIC / SOC RTL Design and Verification, Physical Design flow and Timing Signoff.\n\
